# Explanation of `delete fields.field;`

## Current Code
```javascript
delete fields.field;
```

## What It Does
- Attempts to delete a property named 'field' from the `fields` object
- However, this is unnecessary because:
  1. The property 'field' doesn't exist in the object
  2. The object uses field names (like 'CS', 'Math') as keys, not 'field'

## Correct Approach
The `delete` statement should be removed entirely as it serves no purpose. The code works correctly without it because:
1. The `fields` object only contains valid field names as keys
2. The for-in loop already handles only the existing fields

## Example
Given this `fields` object:
```javascript
{
  'CS': ['John', 'Alice'],
  'Math': ['Jane', 'Bob']
}
```

The statement `delete fields.field;` would:
1. Look for a property named 'field'
2. Find nothing (since 'CS' and 'Math' are the only properties)
3. Do nothing

## Recommendation
Simply remove this line as it provides no benefit and could cause confusion.
